#### API Key
Username and password combined that uniquely identifies you.
#### SOAP API (Simple Object Access Protocol)
Client and server exchange messages per XML. It's a less flexible API and was known.
#### RPC (Remote Procedure Calls)
Client executes a function on the server and the server sends the output back.
#### Websocket API
Uses JSON-Objects to transfer data. Supports two-way communication between clients and servers. The server can send recall messages to the client, which makes it more efficient than the **REST API**.
#### REST API
Mostly used and flexible. Client sends requests to the server and the server uses that request to execute internal functions and send the output data back to the client.
